# STM32-EMG-Biosignal , HANDOFF (as of 2026-06-09)

Read this when continuing in a fresh chat. Repo: CanGitArchive/STM32-EMG-Biosignal (PRIVATE) at
`S:\Coding\STM32-EMG-Biosignal`. Owner: Can Kadilar. Second hardware portfolio piece (after the
EMG prosthetic-hand thesis): a myoelectric gripper on real STM32 firmware. Edge-AI / embedded.

## STATE: on-chip, standalone, VERIFIED (2026-06-09)

The board reads the muscle, does the DSP + the open/close decision ON-CHIP, drives the gripper, and
fails safe, all standalone. The laptop is just a viewer/logger now.

Firmware = a clean C++ super-loop of header-only classes in `src/` (a super-loop is the CURRENT
implementation, not an RTOS , FreeRTOS is still an OPEN deliverable, see "Known deviations" below):
- `Emg` (Emg.h): ADC on PA0; `read()` returns one 0..4095 sample.
- `MuscleTrigger` (MuscleTrigger.h): the brain. Live baseline tracker (slow EMA, RATE 0.001),
  centering (`centered = raw - baseline`), dip detection (fire once when `centered <= -425` while
  armed and past the lockout; re-arm when `centered` climbs back above -150; LOCKOUT 25 samples
  ~125 ms bounce-guard keyed off the RELEASE), and the signal-loss failsafe (raw outside [25,3000]
  = bad; invalid until 200 clean samples ~1 s; while invalid it holds + freezes the baseline).
- `Servo` (Servo.h): SG90 PWM on PB6 / TIM4_CH1; `open()`/`close()`/`toggle()` choose a position,
  `ease()` glides toward it (slew-limited), `setRotationSpeed()` tunes the step.
- `Comms` (Comms.h): USART2 (USB VCP); `sendStatus()` streams "raw,centered,valid". (The old
  `S<us>` receive path is present but unused now the chip decides; candidate for a cleanup pass.)
- `Timer` (Timer.h): `waitForNextTick(5)` = drift-free 200 Hz; `pause(ms)` = blocking delay.
- `main.cpp`: make the objects, then loop {read -> trigger.update -> on a dip servo.toggle ->
  servo.ease -> comms.sendStatus -> timer.waitForNextTick(5)}, plus the SysTick + USART2 handlers.

Behavior VERIFIED on hardware (2026-06-09): a flex toggles the gripper, one toggle per flex,
including fast wrist-flicks (Can's low-fatigue method); pulling an electrode -> gripper holds, no
haywire; reattach -> works again after ~1 s. Tunables are named consts at the bottom of
MuscleTrigger.h (Can set LOCKOUT 25 and RAIL_LOW 25 himself).

## How we got here (short)

At the start of THIS (5th) session (2026-06-09, NOT day one of the project) an "ultracode" run
autonomously built a FreeRTOS port before Can could weigh in; it was rolled back entirely for being
autonomous, NOT because FreeRTOS was rejected (see "Known deviations"). Then, one step at a time with Can: refactored the streamer
into his C++ header-only-class style; CP1 ported baseline+centering on-chip (verified: rest ~0, flex
dives to ~-693); CP2 added the on-chip dip detector + toggle + signal-loss failsafe (verified). The
laptop decision is retired; `operate.py` remains only as a laptop toggle fallback.

## Hardware / wiring

- Nucleo-F446RE (Cortex-M4F). Powers/flashes over Mini-USB (not micro). Toolchain = PlatformIO
  (`framework = stm32cube`, board `nucleo_f446re`). pio CLI: `~/.platformio/penv/Scripts/pio.exe`
  (NOT on PATH). Clock = HSI 16 MHz (no SystemClock_Config; deliberate, keeps the validated
  servo/UART/ADC timings, e.g. TIM4 prescaler 16 -> 1 us tick).
- EMG: Grove EMG Detector analog out -> PA0 / A0 (ADC1). Power Grove from 3V3. Electrodes:
  red+black on palmaris longus, white reference on the wrist.
- Servo: SG90 on TIM4_CH1 / PB6 (D10). Signal -> D10, V+ -> separate 6 V pack, GND -> battery AND
  Nucleo GND (shared ground mandatory). Measured: open 1300 us, close 1600 us.
- Gripper: 3D-printed involute-gear pincher (gear math in docs/gripper_mechanics.md).
- CAN (not built yet): MCP2515 over SPI, planned on SPI2 , see docs/wiring.md.

## Laptop tools (tools/emg_studio/, PyQt6 + pyqtgraph)

- `chip_monitor.py` , THE viewer for the current on-chip stream: live centered graph with the
  -425 / -150 lines + a SIGNAL OK/LOST banner + decimated CSV logging to logs/. Run:
  `python chip_monitor.py --port COM6` (close other COM users first; one program per COM port).
  Lag lesson: keep disk I/O OFF the serial-reader thread AND fix the plot X range (`setXRange`,
  auto-range off) or the GUI auto-range churn starves the reader and it rubber-bands. `--antialias`
  for silky lines (slower fullscreen).
- `operate.py` , the old laptop DTW/decision app, now only a toggle fallback. `emg_studio.py`
  (shared serial/DSP core for the OLD 1-value stream) and `calibrate.py` (DTW templates) predate the
  on-chip port. chip_monitor.py is the one that matches the current firmware.

## Build / flash / CI

- Build: `& "C:\Users\kadil\.platformio\penv\Scripts\pio.exe" run -d "S:\Coding\STM32-EMG-Biosignal"`.
  Flash: add `-t upload` (ST-LINK over Mini-USB). CI builds `pio run` on every push.
- Latest commit: see `git log` (do not hardcode a hash here , it goes stale the next commit).

## Known deviations from the original scope (NOT approved cuts , flagged by the 2026-06-09 audit)

The first chat's step list + the Able JD competency table call for these; they are NOT done. An
earlier handoff wrongly recorded the DSP as "done" and FreeRTOS as a settled cut. They are open work,
not closed decisions:
- FreeRTOS / RTOS , the current loop is a super-loop; the "sample / process / comms tasks"
  deliverable (and the JD's RTOS row) is OPEN. Can never decided to drop it.
- DMA + timer-triggered ADC , the scope wants timer-triggered ADC + DMA; the firmware POLLS the ADC
  once per loop (inherited from the streamer). Not flagged at the time; open.
- CMSIS-DSP band-pass / feature extraction , on-chip processing is only a lightweight EMA baseline +
  centering (enough for the dip detector, but it does not cover the DSP competency).

## NEXT (Can picks, one at a time)

- CAN (MCP2515 over SPI): broadcast gesture/telemetry; decode on the 24 MHz logic analyzer. Biggest
  remaining JD competency + best demo visual. Needs the MCP2515 module wired.
- IWDG watchdog: reboots the chip if the code hangs (the signal-loss failsafe is already done).
- The open competencies above (FreeRTOS, DMA+timer ADC, CMSIS-DSP) if Can wants the full JD spread.
- Ship: README (turn a chip_log CSV into a clean graph) + demo video + CV line (STM32 / on-chip EMG / CAN).

## Reference docs in this repo

- `FIRMWARE_MAP.md` , what each src file is + the detector knobs (the nav doc; no per-file banners, by Can's rule).
- `docs/lessons_learned.md` , the EMG control saga + the half-wave-rectify-echo root cause + the
  "look at the RAW signal before theorizing about hardware" lesson. Read before touching the detector.
- `docs/gripper_mechanics.md` (gear math), `docs/wiring.md`, `docs/emg_noise_findings.md`, `docs/phased_plan.md`.
